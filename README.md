# Kinten's ppx-expect

expect-test (a.k.a. ppx-k-expect, `Ppx_k_expect`) is a framework for writing Cram-like tests in OCaml. It is heavily inspired by Janestreet's [Expect-test](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_expect), which is an amazing framework in and of itself and is natively integrated with Dune, but that integration means I couldn't use it in other OCaml build systems which was a source of frustration for me.
